Vectors are the points which are Generated as such from the mathematical concepts of length and magnitude containing Object, in which two points will be their in which the the dependent right angle triangle will be formed withe set of side we can calculate the pythogerous theorem and hold the lengthe and angle with points.
<br/>

Paper JS is one of the best library holding the implementation in core about Vectors
<br/>
Linear Interpolation is concept if character movement in transition withe update interval frames in the Animation which delta t, in which we can understand the movement in Animation fashions as such linear, ease in, ease, ease out, bounce, etc.
