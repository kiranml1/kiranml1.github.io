Trignomentry is a mathematical concept deriving the Geomentry Co-ordinates around right angle triangles. We basically dont give much importance in our basic coding unless we try to visually potray some thing in circlular entities.<br/>

[Visual Experiment on Trignomentry](http://kiranml1.github.io/researchdemos/demos/trignomentry/)

Their is a name for this right angle triangles sides - opposite, adjacent, hypotenuse <br/>

With the ratios of the sides we decide the triangle's properties <br/>

in triangle we basically follow below points:<br/>

Pythograrous theorem: (opposite)*(opposite) + (adjacent)*(adjacent) = (hypotenuse)*(hypotenuse)<br/>

The sum of angles in the right angle triangle is 180 degrees<br/>
A+B+90 = 180<br/>

Ratio of sides - SOH CAH TOA<br/>

Sin X = opp/hyp<br/>
Cos X = adj/hyp<br/>
Tan X = opp/adj<br/>

The above given formulae help in computing the triangle based visualization. namely Sine Wave.<br/>

Relation between the complements of a right angle triangle in trignomentry:<br/>

Sin X = Cos (90-X) ==> Sin 30 = Cos 60<br/>
Cos X = Sin (90-X) ==> Cos 30 = Sin 60<br/>

Inverse Functions<br/>

Sin^-1(opp/hyp) = X<br/>
Cos^-1(adj/hyp) = X<br/>
Tan^-1(opp/adj) = X<br/>

In inverse Trignomentric Functions : Their will be periodic Distributions for the Values<br/>

As suppose if Sin(45) = Sin(135) = opp/adj, which means the values may occur in periodic system
in Which the X will be common for multiple Angles so Domain Restriction is typical term in which means like (PI/2,-PI/2) to give out the range which is set for us So angles must be determined in a restricted set to give our values.<br/>

atan2(x,y) will give the angle for us to determine the sine and cosine for our systems it is inverse of tangent for the x,y co-ordienates it helpful in giving the value of angle in specific quandrant from PI,-PI.<br/>
[Tan2 Example](http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/14602/what-are-atan-and-atan2-used-for-in-games)

In Angles will be positive in counter-clockwise direction and negative in clockwise direction
