This blog post is hoping to let you know how d3 scales work with a general idea of function and inverse of it and in mathematics, it can be figured as below

function
f(x) = x*100;
domain range

inverse of function
f^1(x*100) =  x
inverse domain range

discrete - 0,1,2,3,4 - having a set of values <br/>
continuous - 0,100,200,300 ... - having a periodic state of progression or negation in the set of values

ordinal - discrete domain to continuous range
quantitative - continuous domain to continuous/discrete range

d3 scales :
-----------
d3 linear scale - linearly map the domain to range given <br/>
d3.pow, d3.sqrt. d3.identity, d3.log scales

d3.quantize scale it will quantify the domain and map it to range in discrete values (domain will be quantified with segments)
d3.quantiles scale it will quantile the domain to map the rnage in dicrete values (domain will progress in division with domain in values index)
d3.threshold will map the scale to set of domain values to range in set of values in sequence to give the range from scale(-1) to scale(n) with each subset.
