Voronoi is Geomentrical Concept in which the points are aligned in such an order which lets to know the which point is closer in the site of other point, which is essentially used in maps and graphs for flexible understanding of closest point.<br/>

Voronoi definition:
In mathematics, a Voronoi diagram is a way of dividing space into a number of regions. A set of points (called seeds, sites, or generators) is specified beforehand and for each seed there will be a corresponding region consisting of all points closer to that seed than to any other. The regions are called Voronoi cells. It is dual to the Delaunay triangulation.
