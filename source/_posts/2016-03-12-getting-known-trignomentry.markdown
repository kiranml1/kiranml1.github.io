Trignomentry is a subject derived from Geometry in mathematics and it usually works in 2D co-ordinate system with right angle triangles (perpendicular sides).
We usually dont mind for writing any logic around this concept, until we try to visualize any element in circular values.

Check my experiment on this subject, It gives a little idea

** Go to **[Experiment](http://kiranml1.github.io/researchdemos/demos/trignomentry/)

When this subject comes into play, a basic figure should come into our imagination.
Which should be as below:

{% img left https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Rtriangle.svg/220px-Rtriangle.svg.png 320 250 Right Angle Triangle Fig-1 %}

In Fig-1, we have sides - a, b, c of 90&deg; sided triangle

a - **opposite**  b - **adjacent**  c - **hypotenuse**

a,b,c are line segments with a positive value in length and few combinational ratios on these sides gives some circular values.

sin &#1012; = b &divide; c ( Here &#1012; can be &ang;A | &ang;B )

cos &#1012; = a &divide; c ( Here &#1012; can be &ang;B | &ang;A )

tan &#1012; = a &divide; b ( Here &#1012; depend on sin &#1012; and cos &#1012; )

Above properties of the triangle describe the ratios of sides of a &perp; triangle, which substitute a circle ratio
from a quarter in complete circle.

[//]: # Need to author on below section

in triangle we basically follow below points:<br/>

Pythograrous theorem: (opposite)*(opposite) + (adjacent)*(adjacent) = (hypotenuse)*(hypotenuse)<br/>

The sum of angles in the right angle triangle is 180 degrees<br/>
A+B+90 = 180<br/>

Ratio of sides - SOH CAH TOA<br/>

Sin X = opp/hyp<br/>
Cos X = adj/hyp<br/>
Tan X = opp/adj<br/>

The above given formulae help in computing the triangle based visualization. namely Sine Wave.<br/>

Relation between the complements of a right angle triangle in trignomentry:<br/>

Sin X = Cos (90-X) ==> Sin 30 = Cos 60<br/>
Cos X = Sin (90-X) ==> Cos 30 = Sin 60<br/>

Inverse Functions<br/>

Sin^-1(opp/hyp) = X<br/>
Cos^-1(adj/hyp) = X<br/>
Tan^-1(opp/adj) = X<br/>

In inverse Trignomentric Functions : Their will be periodic Distributions for the Values<br/>

As suppose if Sin(45) = Sin(135) = opp/adj, which means the values may occur in periodic system
in Which the X will be common for multiple Angles so Domain Restriction is typical term in which means like (PI/2,-PI/2) to give out the range which is set for us So angles must be determined in a restricted set to give our values.<br/>

atan2(x,y) will give the angle for us to determine the sine and cosine for our systems it is inverse of tangent for the x,y co-ordienates it helpful in giving the value of angle in specific quandrant from PI,-PI.<br/>
[Tan2 Example](http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/14602/what-are-atan-and-atan2-used-for-in-games)

In Angles will be positive in counter-clockwise direction and negative in clockwise direction
