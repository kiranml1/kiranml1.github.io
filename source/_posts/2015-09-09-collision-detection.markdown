Collision Detection is a common concept in understanding the collision between the two objects in a plane in which the detection is identified in properties of the position. <br/>

I found a great article in knowing the about the collision detection: <br/>

[Collision Detection Example](http://devmag.org.za/2009/04/13/basic-collision-detection-in-2d-part-1/)

In the above article we can find three basic collision object planes

1. Circular Collision Detection
2. Box Collision Detection
3. Line Intersection Detection

Collision detection is done by a no of updated checks in which we can use Quadtree to reduce the space to check and no of checks to improve our algotithm.
