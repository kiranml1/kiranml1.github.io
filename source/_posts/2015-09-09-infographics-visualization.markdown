Infographics are the information with graphics which convey the meaning of data. Info graphics are useful in multiple sets of domain as we can say

## Features

1.	Infographics
2.	Print
3.	Animation
4.	Interactive
5.	Presentation
6.	Video

[Research Visuaization](http://researchvisualisation.com/)

We basically need to design the information </br>
We need skills of visualization which needs a skill set as below:

1.	Research Skills
2.	Data Visualization Skills
3.	Graphic Skills
4.	Programming Skills

[Infographics Learning](http://learnnovators.com/infographics-learning/)

We need to improve out Mathematical and Dynamics in Physics in 2D & 3D Environments to Model our Prototype. <br/>

Learning the Visualization can be done by improving above skills and research with visualisation groups and labs

1.	Research Papers
2.	Algorithms
3.	Animation & Interactive stories
3.	Data Visualization as such maps, graphs, charts

We need to understand Visualization papers and visually present the paper.
